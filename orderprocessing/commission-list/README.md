## Commission List

The commission list page lists all the sales persons commissions, volumes and customers they have `worked on and not
yet approved by an order-processoring user (FRANK for now)`.
Once an order processor (**FRANK**) approves their commission, then they appear in the commission ledger list ready for 
payment.
