This page is share by the front-desk as well, however, there are a few functionalities that are available for production
that the front desk will not be able to see. These include.
- **Scheduling a service for selected customer**. the scheduled service will appear under the unassigned column on the
production dashboard.
  #### Scheduling a customer's service appointment from the customer's page
  * When scheduling a customer from the customer's page, please fill in the customer concern, and the required fields which
  include (`Date`, `Duration`), if these fields are left unfilled, an error will be thrown.
  * The basic customer information will be auto filled so no worries about filling that in.
