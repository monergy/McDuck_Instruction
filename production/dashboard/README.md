## Dashboard.

The production Dashboard is a tab calendar that lists and handles 4 calendars.
**Service calendar, Service Inspector Calendar Supervisor calendar, and Electrician calendar.**

All these four calendars
have the same layout and pretty much the same functionality as listed below.
   1. A service is a job that is requested by the client (lead) and scheduled by production depending on the available slots
   and free time for their crews from the calendar.
   2. When scheduling a customer, if the customer being scheduled is not under warranty or when their warranty has expired,
      a warning will be popped onto the screen, the same information is shown on the customer's page under the warranty 
      column.
   3. After creating a scheduling for a customer, the customer will be put under the unassigned column on the right hand
    side of the page from which production can select a crew to assign to them and then the appointment will be shown on
    the calendar.
   4. Customer schedules that appear on the calendar can be edited, and the following edits are allowed:
        1. Add or change a color for the schedule.
        2. Changing the _appointment time_ (`Date`), _Arrival Time_, _Crew_, and the _Note_.

###### Note
* _These calendars are weekly-based._
* _The calendar provides maneuverability capabilities which include using left and right arrows on top left hand up
  above every calendar and also picking a date in a week from which an entire week will be drawn out on the calendar._
