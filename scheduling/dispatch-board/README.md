## Dispatch Board

The dispatch board is a visual of the assigned and unassigned job types on the different calendars.

There are four types of calendars that are visible for the Unassigned calendars.
1. Weekly days against time slots `8 AM - 6 PM`.
This calendar is plotted days against time, and it used to list all the unassigned jobs on the Ez breathe, service,
   electrical and reinstatement tabs.

   This calendar is plotted directions against days, and it used to list all the unassigned jobs on the waterproofing,
   and rebuild tabs.

#### General calendar functionality.
* To access the unassigned or assigned schedules on the calendar, toggle between the `assigned and unassigned` buttons.
* To add a crew to an unassigned job, click on the job in the calendar, it will pop up a modal and then select a crew
to assign to the unassigned scheduled job.

* The default calendar on the Ez Breathe and waterproofing calendar is the `unassinged calendar` while the default calendar
for the rest of the tabs is the `assigned calendar`.
