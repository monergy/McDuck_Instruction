## Dispatch Board

The dispatch board is a visual of the assigned and unassigned job types on the different calendars.

There are four types of calendars that are visible for the Unassigned calendars.
1. Weekly days against time slots `8 AM - 6 PM`
This calendar is plotted days against time, and it lists all the unassigned jobs for Ez breathe, service, electrical and
reinstatement.
