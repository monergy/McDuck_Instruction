## Limit calendar.

On the limit Calendar page, users can create available time slots and jobTypes/footage/units for job types that production
crews will be able to work on.

These created time slots are made available for confirmation to pick from when selecting particular dates of installation
for a given job. (_please read the IMPORTANT note under the notes section._)

There are three calendar tabs on this page.
1. **Ez Breathe/ StableWall**. This calendar shows and captures the number of job types for ezBreathe and stable wall
that production crews will be able to work on. [`job-type against direction`]
