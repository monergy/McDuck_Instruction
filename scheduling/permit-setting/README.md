## Permit Settings.

In the permit settings page, we can add a new permit setting for a city, any lead that lies with in a city that has a
permit will have a red boarder around it's card on both the scheduling and order-processing dashboards.
This will mean that before any job is performed for this specific customer, production would need to apply for the city's
permit. The steps for the permit application can be altered and viewed from the order-processing dashboard user the
permit tab for every selected customer.
